# Portfolio

### Hi, I’m Nancy!
I am a graduating student with hands-on experience in **data analytics, data science, UX/UI research, and programming**.

My primary interest is in **full-time Data Analyst roles**, where I use data to generate insights, support decision-making, and clearly communicate findings to stakeholders.

At the same time, I remain open to **opportunities in data science, UX design, or product management**, where I can apply my technical skills, analytical thinking, and user-centered design experience to deliver impactful solutions.

This repository serves as a **central hub** linking my **[academic](https://github.com/nefelibata28/NTU-Academic-Projects) and personal projects**.

 **[NTU Academic Projects](https://github.com/nefelibata28/NTU-Academic-Projects) – A collection of my coursework and projects from Nanyang Technological University (NTU).**
